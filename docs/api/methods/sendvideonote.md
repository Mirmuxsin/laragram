# sendVideoNote

As of [v.4.0](https://telegram.org/blog/video-messages-and-telescope), Telegram clients support rounded square MPEG4 videos of up to 1 minute long. Use this method to send video messages. On success, the sent [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#message) is returned.

## Usage

```php
use Milly\Laragram\Laragram;

$result = Laragram::sendVideoNote($business_connection_id = null, $chat_id, $message_thread_id = null, $video_note, $duration = null, $length = null, $thumbnail = null, $disable_notification = null, $protect_content = null, $allow_paid_broadcast = null, $message_effect_id = null, $reply_parameters = null, $reply_markup = null);
```

## Parameters

- **$business_connection_id** (`string|null`): Unique identifier of the business connection on behalf of which the message will be sent
- **$chat_id** (`any_of`): Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format `@channelusername`)
- **$message_thread_id** (`integer|null`): Unique identifier for the target message thread (topic) of the forum; for forum supergroups only
- **$video_note** (`any_of`): Video note to send. Pass a file\_id as String to send a video note that exists on the Telegram servers (recommended) or upload a new video using multipart/form-data. [More information on Sending Files »](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#sending-files). Sending video notes by a URL is currently unsupported
- **$duration** (`integer|null`): Duration of sent video in seconds
- **$length** (`integer|null`): Video width and height, i.e. diameter of the video message
- **$thumbnail** (`any_of|null`): Thumbnail of the file sent; can be ignored if thumbnail generation for the file is supported server-side. The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 kB in size. A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320. Ignored if the file is not uploaded using multipart/form-data. Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file, so you can pass “attach://\<file\_attach\_name\>” if the thumbnail was uploaded using multipart/form-data under \<file\_attach\_name\>. [More information on Sending Files »](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#sending-files)
- **$disable_notification** (`bool|null`): Sends the message [silently](https://telegram.org/blog/channels-2-0#silent-messages). Users will receive a notification with no sound.

The relevant Stars will be withdrawn from the bot's balance
- **$message_effect_id** (`string|null`): Unique identifier of the message effect to be added to the message; for private chats only
- **$reply_parameters** (`ReplyParameters|null`): Description of the message to reply to
- **$reply_markup** (`any_of|null`): Additional interface options.
