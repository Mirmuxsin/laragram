* sendVoice
 *
 *Use this method to send audio files, if you want Telegram clients to display the file as a playable voice message. For this to work, your audio must be in an .OGG file encoded with OPUS (other formats may be sent as [Audio](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#audio) or [Document](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#document)). On success, the sent [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#message) is returned. Bots can currently send voice messages of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.
